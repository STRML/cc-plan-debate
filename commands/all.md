# AI Multi-Model Plan Review (acpx)

Run all configured AI reviewers in parallel via acpx, synthesize their feedback, debate contradictions, and produce a final consensus verdict. Max 3 total revision rounds.

Arguments:
- First arg: optional comma-separated reviewer names (e.g. `codex,gemini`). Defaults to all from config.
- `skip-debate` — skip the targeted debate phase, go straight to final report.

**Reviewer config** (`~/.claude/debate-acpx.json`):
!`cat ~/.claude/debate-acpx.json 2>/dev/null || echo '{"error":"Config not found — run /debate:acpx-setup first."}'`

---

## Step 1: Prerequisites & Setup

### 1a. Validate config

The config is already loaded above. If it contains `"error"`, stop:
```text
Config not found: ~/.claude/debate-acpx.json
Run /debate:acpx-setup to create it.
```

Parse reviewer list. If a comma-separated reviewer list was passed as argument, filter to only those reviewers. Validate each reviewer has an `agent` field.

### 1b. Generate session ID & temp dir

Verify `~/.claude/debate-scripts` exists. If not:
```text
~/.claude/debate-scripts not found.
Run /debate:setup first to create the stable scripts symlink.
```

Run setup:
```bash
bash ~/.claude/debate-scripts/debate-setup.sh
```

Note `REVIEW_ID`, `WORK_DIR`, and `SCRIPT_DIR` from output.

### 1c. Announce

List the reviewers that will run:

```text
## acpx Review — Starting

Reviewers:
  codex    → agent: codex    (120s)
  gemini   → agent: gemini   (240s)
  mercury  → agent: mercury  (120s)
```

### 1d. Verify sessions

`invoke-acpx.sh` creates a new acpx session before every review run — no manual session creation is needed. If a reviewer fails with exit code 4 (session creation failed), it means the agent CLI is not installed or not authenticated. In that case, suggest running `/debate:acpx-setup` to diagnose.

### 1e. Capture the plan

First check whether a plan exists in the current conversation context. If no plan is present, ask the user to paste it or describe what to review. Once a plan is available, write it to `<WORK_DIR>/plan.md`.

---

## Step 2: Parallel Review (Round N)

Track a round counter starting at 1. Check `ROUND <= 3` before executing each round — if exceeded, go to the "max rounds reached" block in Step 7.

Run all reviewers in parallel via the runner script:

```bash
bash "<SCRIPT_DIR>/run-parallel-acpx.sh" "~/.claude/debate-acpx.json" "<REVIEW_ID>" [reviewer1,reviewer2,...]
```

If a reviewer subset was specified, pass the comma-separated list as the third argument. Use `timeout: 480000` on the Bash call (the runner blocks until all reviewers complete or time out).

**Cleanup:** If the run fails or the user interrupts, always run `rm -rf <WORK_DIR>` before stopping.

### Check results

For each configured reviewer, read:
- `<WORK_DIR>/<name>-exit.txt` — exit code
- `<WORK_DIR>/<name>-output.md` — review text

Exit code meanings:
- `0` — success
- `4` — session creation failed (agent not installed or not authenticated)
- `124` — timed out
- Other — error (check `<name>-stderr.log` and `<name>-invoke.log` for details)

**If all reviewers failed:**
```text
## acpx Review — UNDECIDED

All reviewers failed or timed out. No synthesis is possible.

Options:
- Check agent availability with /debate:acpx-setup
- Re-run /debate:all
```
Then clean up and exit.

---

## Step 3: Present Reviewer Outputs

For each completed reviewer:

```text
---
## <Name> Review — Round N (<Agent>)

[content of <name>-output.md]
```

For failed/timed-out reviewers:
```text
## <Name> Review — Round N

⚠️ <Name> timed out / failed (exit <code>). Skipping.
```

---

## Step 4: Synthesize

Read all successful reviewer outputs and categorize:

```text
## Synthesis — Round N

### Unanimous Agreements
- [Points all reviewers agree on]

### Unique Insights
- [Reviewer]: [Point only this reviewer raised]

### Contradictions
- Point A: <Reviewer1> says X, <Reviewer2> says Y
```

Extract each verdict. Determine overall:
- All APPROVED → skip debate, go to Step 6
- Any REVISE → continue to Step 5
- Only 1 reviewer succeeded → skip debate, use that verdict as final

---

## Step 5: Targeted Debate (unless `skip-debate` was passed or fewer than 2 reviewers succeeded)

Max 2 debate rounds. Skip if no contradictions.

For each contradiction, write a debate prompt to `<WORK_DIR>/<name>-prompt.txt`:

```bash
cat > <WORK_DIR>/<name>-prompt.txt << 'DEBATE_EOF'
There is a disagreement on [topic].

The other reviewer's position:
[quote the specific disagreement from the other reviewer's output]

Your position:
[quote their specific position]

Do you stand by your position, or does the other reviewer's point change your assessment?
Be specific. End with VERDICT: APPROVED or VERDICT: REVISE.
DEBATE_EOF
```

Then re-run just the debating reviewers via invoke-acpx.sh directly (the prompt file will be picked up automatically):

```bash
bash "<SCRIPT_DIR>/invoke-acpx.sh" "~/.claude/debate-acpx.json" "<WORK_DIR>" "<name>"
```

Read the updated `<name>-output.md` and present:

```text
### Debate Round N — [Topic]

**<Reviewer1>:** [response]
**<Reviewer2>:** [response]

**Resolution:** [resolved/unresolved, why]
```

After each debate exchange, delete the prompt file: `rm -f <WORK_DIR>/<name>-prompt.txt`

---

## Step 6: Final Report

```text
---
## acpx Review — Final Report (Round N of 3)

### Consensus Points
- [Things all reviewers agreed on]

### Unresolved Disagreements
- [Contradictions that remained after debate]

### Claude's Recommendation
[Synthesis: highest-priority concern, is the plan ready?]

### Overall VERDICT
VERDICT: APPROVED — All reviewers approved the plan.
   OR
VERDICT: REVISE — [Reviewer(s)] identified concerns that should be addressed.
   OR
VERDICT: SPLIT — Reviewers disagree. [Summary]. Claude recommends: [proceed/revise].
```

---

## Step 7: Revision Loop (if REVISE or SPLIT, max 3 total rounds)

1. **Claude revises the plan** — address highest-priority concerns
2. Write revision summary:
   ```bash
   cat > <WORK_DIR>/revisions.txt << 'EOF'
   [Revision bullets]
   EOF
   ```
3. Show revisions to user:
   ```text
   ### Revisions (Round N)
   - [What changed and why]
   ```
4. Rewrite `<WORK_DIR>/plan.md` with the revised plan
5. For each reviewer, write a context-rich prompt for the next round:
   ```bash
   cat > <WORK_DIR>/<name>-prompt.txt << 'REVISION_EOF'
   The plan has been revised based on reviewer feedback.

   Changes made:
   [content of revisions.txt]

   Updated plan:
   [content of plan.md]

   Re-review the updated plan. If your previous concerns were addressed, acknowledge it.
   End with VERDICT: APPROVED or VERDICT: REVISE.
   REVISION_EOF
   ```
6. Return to **Step 2** with incremented round counter

If max rounds (3) reached:
```text
## acpx Review — Max Rounds Reached

3 rounds completed. Remaining concerns:
[List unresolved issues]

Options:
- Address remaining concerns manually and re-run
- Proceed at your judgment given the feedback
```

---

## Step 8: Present Final Plan

Read `<WORK_DIR>/plan.md` and display:

```text
---
## Final Plan

[full plan content]

---
Review complete.
```

## Step 9: Cleanup

```bash
rm -rf <WORK_DIR>
```

---

## Rules

- **acpx handles everything** — except `gemini`. Gemini CLI's ACP mode is broken (hangs at initialize). `invoke-acpx.sh` detects `agent: gemini` and falls back to direct CLI invocation (`gemini -s -e ""`), which works with both OAuth and API key auth.
- **Parallel via bash.** `run-parallel-acpx.sh` runs reviewers as nohup/disown background processes from the main agent's context. No subagents needed — no permission inheritance issues.
- **Debate via direct invoke.** Debate rounds call `invoke-acpx.sh` directly from the main agent (not subagents). Prompt files are picked up automatically.
- **No session resume needed.** acpx manages sessions internally. Each round injects full context via prompt files.
- **Config is king.** Adding a reviewer = adding an entry to `~/.claude/debate-acpx.json`.
- **Security:** Never inline plan content or AI output in shell strings — use files.
- **Timeout:** Each reviewer's timeout is in the config. The runner adds a 60s buffer to MAX_WAIT automatically.
- **Graceful degradation:** If a reviewer fails, skip it in synthesis. If all fail, return UNDECIDED.
- **Debate guard:** Skip debate if fewer than 2 reviewers succeeded.
- **Revision discipline:** Make real improvements, not cosmetic changes.
- **User control:** If a revision would contradict the user's explicit requirements, skip it and note it.
