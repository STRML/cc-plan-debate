# Frontend — debate plugin
_Updated: 2026-03-01_

## Note

This is a Claude Code CLI plugin — there is no web frontend. "Frontend" here means the user-facing interface: slash commands and their output formatting.

## Slash Commands (User Interface)

```
/debate:setup               Check prerequisites; create stable symlink; print settings.json snippet
/debate:acpx-setup          Interactive reviewer config + agent probe
/debate:all                 Full parallel review + synthesis + debate (recommended)
/debate:all skip-debate     Skip targeted debate phase
/debate:opus-review         Iterative Opus loop — TeamCreate+SendMessage if available, subagent fallback
```

## Output Format

### Prerequisite Summary (`/debate:all` Step 1)
```

```

## Allowed Tools (Command Frontmatter)

Commands declare their tool permissions in YAML frontmatter using `allowed-tools:`. This enables Claude Code to auto-approve calls within the declared scope, avoiding per-call permission prompts.

`/debate:setup` prints the exact `settings.json` snippet for session-persistent approval.
